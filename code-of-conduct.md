#SNDMakes Code of Conduct

SNDMakes is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or position on religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form, in particularâ€¦ sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, parties, Twitter, our Slack channel, and other online media.

Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody. We want to be known as the friendliest and most considerate event.
