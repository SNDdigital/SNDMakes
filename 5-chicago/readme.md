## Team Argyle

How can we take what game companies have used to create better communities and encourage positive behavior, and apply those lessons to news media? News organizations have large number of people participating on their websites, but the environment is often toxic and unwelcoming to members. We’re not trying to fix this entirely—instead we’d like to figure out what tools we might give to communities to self-regulate. 

## Team Bronzeville

**Mirror, Mirror** is a game that helps players confront their unknown biases by exposing them to ways of life at different intersections of race, gender, socioeconomic status and ability. Players are assigned a randomized profile based on these four criteria, but here’s the catch: the player doesn’t know who their profile is. Instead, they must navigate their character’s life and use contextual clues to figure out who they are by the end of the day. Through this game, players can experience life at different levels of advantage, and help them empathize with people whose stories and backgrounds differ from their own.

## Team Mayfair

**Platform**​ is a Creative Commons-licensed card game in which players gather voters by collecting a series of positions on topical issues. It engages a millenial audience (such as the readers of BuzzFeed Politics, Vox, and Fusion) in localized, offline community building and encourages political participation. In doing so, we’re bridging the gap between news consumers and game players and paving the way for more informative gaming.

## Team Printers Row

Players are hungry for new experiences, and developers are starved for playtesters — especially in the early stages of design. I Want In presents developers with a community of players who are given the opportunity to identify their interest in a given game project, and ask a developer to be included in a playtest cycle. Developers can select who they're letting into their tests, and can reward the best playtesters with badges and other tokens - including retail game codes - to raise their profile in the community making them more likely to be included in other projects.

## Team Pullman

One of the biggest problems for indie developers is that they have to do their own PR and marketing, but cold-pitching to game journalists is a pain point. **Outpost** creates a community that helps developers find each other, make referrals to journalists, and see what types of articles are getting published all in one place. We’re initially focused on socially conscious game developers.

## Team Rogers Park

We are building a game recommendation engine that takes a choose-your-own adventure approach to help non-gamers who express an inability to navigate current discovery options, begin playing without feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, or alienated. By increasing the approachability of gaming through a tool designed for these beginners, we meet this need, while increasing the customer base for game developers.

## Team Sauganash

Our premise is that people have a hard time articulating feedback. They say, "Your game sucks" or "This is boring" or "This game is too hard." It’s qualitative feedback, but it’s not immediately actionable. We're building a means for game developers to facilitate a conversation with their users about a feeling that may be hard for them to articulate without a structured conversation.
